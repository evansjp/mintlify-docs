## Welcome to the Turret API

Turret provides a simple HTTP API for tracking user events with free-form text metadata. Our API analyzes this metadata to automatically detect patterns and group similar events.

</Card>

## Authentication

All API requests must include your project API key in the `X-Api-Key` header:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.useturret.com/track \
  -H "X-Api-Key: your_project_api_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

<Warning>
Never expose your API key in client-side code. Always make API calls from your backend services.
</Warning>

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:
```
https://api.useturret.com
```

## Request Format

All requests must:
- Use HTTPS
- Include `Content-Type: application/json` header
- Include `X-Api-Key` header with your project API key
- Send data as JSON in the request body

## Response Format

All responses are returned as JSON with the following structure:

### Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Event tracked successfully",
  "event_id": "evt_1234567890"
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Invalid API key",
  "code": "INVALID_API_KEY"

```

## Rate Limits

Turret implements rate limiting to ensure service quality:

- **Free tier**: 10,000 events per month
- **Pro tier**: 100,000 events per month  
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits

When you exceed your rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with details about when you can retry.

## Error Codes

Common error codes you might encounter:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `INVALID_API_KEY` | The provided API key is invalid or missing |
| `RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | You have exceeded your monthly event limit |
| `INVALID_REQUEST` | The request format is incorrect |
| `MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELD` | Required fields are missing from the request |
| `TEXT_TOO_LONG` | Metadata text exceeds maximum length |
