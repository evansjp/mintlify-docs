## What Are Topics?

Turret automatically groups your events based on semantic similarity in the metadata text. Unlike traditional analytics that only group by exact matches, Turret understands meaning and context.

It leverages the technology powering the state-of-the-art LLMs and semantic clustering algorithms to detect similar keywords and phrases. We call these clusters "topics".

For example, these events would be clustered together as a "topic":
- "How do I reset my password?"
- "I forgot my login credentials"
- "Can't remember my account password"

## How Clustering Works

Turret uses advanced natural language processing to:

1. **Analyze text meaning**: Extract semantic features from your event metadata
2. **Find similarities**: Compare events based on intent and context, not just keywords
3. **Create clusters**: Group events that share similar meanings or patterns
4. **Update dynamically**: Clusters evolve as new events are added
5. **Summarize into topics**: Surface the defining "theme" of this cluster

<Info>
Clustering happens automatically in the background. You don't need to configure anything - just send your events and Turret does the rest.

## Types of Clusters

### Intent-Based Clusters

Groups events by what users are trying to accomplish:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Authentication Issues" icon="lock">
    - "I can't log in"
    - "Password reset not working"
    - "Account locked out"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Feature Requests" icon="lightbulb">
    - "Can you add dark mode?"
    - "Would love to see templates"
    - "Need better export options"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Topic-Based Clusters

Groups events by subject matter:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Technical Support" icon="wrench">
    - "API not responding"
    - "Getting 500 errors"
    - "Integration failing"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Content Creation" icon="pen">
    - "Write a blog post about AI"
    - "Create marketing copy"
    - "Generate product descriptions"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Sentiment-Based Topics

Groups events by emotional tone:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Positive Feedback" icon="thumbs-up">
    - "This is amazing!"
    - "Love the new features"
    - "Exactly what I needed"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Frustration" icon="face-frown">
    - "This is confusing"
    - "Why isn't this working?"
    - "Too complicated"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Viewing Topics in the Dashboard

Your [Turret Dashboard](https://dashboard.useturret.com) shows topics in several ways:

### Topic Overview
- **Label**: Summarization of the topic
- **Size**: Number of events in each topic
- **Growth**: How topics are expanding over time
- **Trends**: Which topics are most active

### Topic Details
- **Representative events**: Key examples from each topic
- **Time series**: How topic activity changes over time
- **Metadata patterns**: Common themes in the clustered events

### Cluster Insights
- **Emerging patterns**: New topics that are forming
- **Anomalies**: Unusual events that don't fit existing topics
- **Correlations**: How topics relate to each other

## Interpreting Cluster Results

### High-Value Topics

Pay special attention to:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Fast-growing topics">
    Rapid growth indicates emerging user needs or pain points that require attention.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="alert" title="Problem-related topics">
    Topics containing error messages, complaints, or confusion signals areas for improvement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="star" title="Feature request topics">
    Groups of similar requests help prioritize product development.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="heart" title="Positive feedback topics">
    Understand what users love most about your product.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Using Topics for Product Decisions

- Action: Redesign export workflow
```

## Best Practices for Topic Analysis

### Regular Review
- Check your dashboard weekly to spot new trends
- Identify user behaviors that you expect and don't expect
- Monitor topic health and diversity

### Cross-Reference with Metrics
- Compare topic activity with business metrics
- Look for correlations between topics and user retention
- Track how addressing topic insights affects user satisfaction

### Team Collaboration
- Share topic insights with product, engineering, and customer success teams
- Use topics to inform sprint planning and roadmap decisions
- Create feedback loops between topic analysis and product development

<Tip>
The most actionable insights often come from topics that represent user pain points or unmet needs. These give you clear direction for product improvements.
