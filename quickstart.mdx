## Get Your API Key

Before you can start tracking events, you'll need to get your API key from the Turret dashboard.

### Create an Account

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user-plus" title="Sign up for Turret">
    Visit the [Turret Dashboard](https://dashboard.useturret.com) and create your account. You'll get a free tier to start experimenting with event tracking.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Get your API key">
    Once logged in, you'll find your API key in the Dashboard. This key will be used to authenticate your requests to the Turret API.
    <Warning>
      Keep your API key secure and never expose it in client-side code. Use it only in your backend services.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Track Your First Event

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="code" title="Make your first API call">
  Use the `/track` endpoint to send your first event. Here's a simple example:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://api.useturret.com/track \
    -H "X-Api-Key: your_project_api_key" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "name": "User asked question",
      "metadata": {
        "prompt": "How do I reset my password?"
      }
    }'
  ```

  The `name` field describes what happened, and the `metadata` object contains the free-form text that Turret will analyze.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="chart-line" title="View your data">
  After sending a few events, visit your [dashboard](https://dashboard.useturret.com) to see how Turret has automatically clustered your events based on semantic similarity.
